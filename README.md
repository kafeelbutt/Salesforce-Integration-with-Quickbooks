# Salesforce-Integration-with-Quickbooks
- I implemented two way integration by using salesforce with quickbooks.
- Customers will be created in Contact object of Salesforce and Companies will be created in Account object of Salesforce.
- Similarly the account records will be created in CompanyInfo Object of quickbooks and contact records will be created in customers object of Quickbooks.
